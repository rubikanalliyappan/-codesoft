    y<p>These traditional candies are made without chemical preservatives and contribute to better health. However, due to the popularity of branded chocolates, they have become less common in the market. Some of these candies, like kamarkattu and elandhavadai, are slowly making a comeback, and enthusiasts hope that they will become more widely available in the future.</p>
